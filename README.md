# T03_CompetitionPlatform

The purpose of our website is to create a platform where users can create accounts,sign in and join competitions.
- I did the first package, called Admin.
- Admin create/delete areas of interest, create/delete competitions and assign judges to competitions.
- I added validations for example only certain judges can be displayed in the assignJudges view if they 
fulfill certain criterias such as they meet the area of interest.

# Design Process
- As an admin, i should be able to create and delete areas of interest so that competitions can be created, assigned to the
area of interest.
- As an admin, i should be able to create and delete competitions based on areas of interest so that competitors can join
competitions and judges can be assigned to judge competitions.
- As an admin, i should be able to assign judges to competitions so that judges have competitions assigned and competitions
have judges assigned.
